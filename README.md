The files below are included within the three-ring binder found within the GSOC Raspberry Pi "Program in a box":

 **GSOC Raspberry Pi Box Setup Instructions.pdf:**
 Start with this pictorial; juniors and cadettes should be able to set up and start the Raspberry Pi by following along with these instructions!

**GSOC Raspberry Pi - LED light project.pdf:**
This is "ground zero" of Raspberry Pi projects, have the girls attempt at least one of the two projects contained within.  Note that neither of the two projects listed within require WiFi connectivity.

**GSOC Raspberry Pi - Photobooth.pdf**
Set up the Raspberry Pi CAMERA (found in the small white box within the Program-In-A-Box) and use python coding to create a PHOTOBOOTH and a SLIDESHOW to show your photobooth images!

**GSOC Raspberry Pi Wifi Connectivity Instructions.pdf**
 If you would like WiFi connectivity for a project (e.g. build a weather station) or for your own experimenting, please follow these instructions.

**GSOC Raspberry Pi Web Serving Weather Station.pdf**
A more complicated project which should only be undertaken after completing the LED light project.  Recommended for Cadettes, Seniors and Ambassadors.  Girls will configure a web page that will display data from a humidity and temperature sensor.  The Raspberry Pi is then configured as a web page so the results can be displayed on a phone or laptop connected to the same WiFi network.
